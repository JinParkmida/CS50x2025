# CS50x 2025 — Course Notes & Problem Set Solutions
### Harvard University’s “Introduction to Computer Science”

This repository tracks my work for **CS50x 2025** on edX.  
Each folder contains source code, solution files, and brief notes for the
corresponding lecture week.

## Course overview

CS50x introduces core computer-science topics:

| Area | Covered in weeks |
|------|------------------|
| Computational thinking & Scratch | Week 0 |
| C language, Linux tool-chain | Weeks 1 – 4 |
| Algorithms & data structures | Weeks 3 – 5 |
| Python scripting | Week 6 |
